Crypto graphic HAsh Functions 
one way func which is infeasible to invert .
small Change in input yields a large Change inthe output .
Deterministics > same inputs yield the same output
unlikely to find two outputs with same values 
Password Hash functions are deliberately slow 



Salts ::
A salt is a random value that is added to Password before we hash it 
It helps ensure the     hashes and mitigate the common attacks
